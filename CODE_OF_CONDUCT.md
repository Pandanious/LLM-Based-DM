## Expected behavior

- Threats or violent language.
- Unwanted sexual attention or advances.
- Sustained disruption of discussions or collaboration spaces.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately to the maintainers. Provide as much detail as possible (who, what, when, where). Reports will be handled promptly, respectfully, and confidentially.

## Enforcement
- Maintainers may warn, temporarily restrict, or remove contributors for violations.
- Severe or repeated violations may result in permanent exclusion from the project spaces.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and interactions related to the project, including issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and community channels.
