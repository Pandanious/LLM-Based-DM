Local RPG Dungeon Master

I built a local-first tabletop RPG assistant that runs entirely on your own machine. It creates rich campaign worlds, NPCs, quests, and items from a simple prompt, then guides players through the adventure with dice-backed decisions and turn-by-turn narration.

What it delivers
- Instant worldbuilding: turn a short idea into a named setting with lore, locations, themes, and skills.
- Playable sessions: manage characters, quests, merchants, and encounters while the DM responds in a consistent tone.
- Fair mechanics: player actions trigger rolls and outcomes are resolved transparently.
- Session memory: saved games can be reloaded, and long chats are summarized so the story stays focused.
- Local privacy: everything runs locally - no cloud calls - so creative ideas and play logs stay on your device.

Why it matters
- Faster prep for game masters and instant adventures for players.
- Collaborative play: multiple players can share the session state and see turn order and recaps.
- Reliability: the DM keeps facts straight by grounding responses in the saved world and session notes.

Who it's for
- Tabletop gamers who want a responsive, consistent digital DM.
- Creators who want to prototype campaign ideas quickly without relying on online services.

Tech Stack
- Python app with a Streamlit interface for play controls and chat.
- Local language model (GGUF via llama.cpp bindings) so all generation runs on-device.
- JSON saves for worlds, characters, quests, and session notes, enabling reloads and grounded context.
- Keyword retrieval over your saved data to keep the DM consistent, plus auto-summaries to manage long sessions.
